In this sentiment classification experiment, we work with the labeled and unlabeled training dataset pertaining to movie reviews, creating various design matrices by using Word2Vec as well as by performing LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic modeling. Afterwards, we will train a four different random forest classifiers and analyze which featurization technique gave the best results for sentiment classification.

To run, open the .ipynb file in iPython Notebook.
