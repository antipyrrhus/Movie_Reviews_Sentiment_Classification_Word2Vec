In this sentiment classification experiment, we work with the labeled and unlabeled training dataset pertaining to movie reviews, creating various design matrices by using Word2Vec as well as by performing LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic modeling. Afterwards, we will train a four different random forest classifiers and analyze which featurization technique gave the best results for sentiment classification.

To run, open the .ipynb file in iPython Notebook.

Be sure to obtain the Google Word2Vec file before running. At the time of this writing, it can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit. Since the file size is very large, it could not be uploaded to this repository, and must be separately downloaded.
